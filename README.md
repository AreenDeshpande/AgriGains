# Crop Prediction and Recommendation System

This project helps users predict crop yield, suggest the best fertilizers, and recommend suitable crops for specific conditions using machine learning models.

## Features

1. **Crop Yield Prediction**:
   - Utilizes **Linear Regression** for basic predictions based on factors like rainfall, temperature, and soil nutrients.
   - For more complex scenarios, a **Random Forest** model is employed to handle non-linear relationships between multiple variables.
   
2. **Fertilizer Recommendation**:
   - Recommends appropriate fertilizers by analyzing soil properties such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (NPK), pH level, and moisture content.
   
3. **Crop Type Suggestion**:
   - Suggests the best crop to grow based on environmental data, soil type, weather, and historical crop performance using machine learning models.
