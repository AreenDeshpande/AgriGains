##Crop Prediction and Recommendation System
This project helps farmers and agricultural enthusiasts to:

Predict Crop Yield: Using weather, soil, and environmental data, it predicts the yield of a specific crop.
Fertilizer Suggestion: Provides recommendations for suitable fertilizers based on soil and crop conditions.
Crop Type Suggestion: Suggests the best crop to grow based on environmental factors, soil type, and past performance.
Features
Crop Yield Prediction:

Implements Linear Regression for simple, continuous yield predictions based on factors like temperature, rainfall, and soil nutrients.
For more complex scenarios, Random Forest Regression is used to capture non-linear relationships between multiple input variables.
Fertilizer Recommendation:

Suggests optimal fertilizer types by analyzing soil nutrient levels (N, P, K), pH, moisture, and crop type.
Crop Type Recommendation:

Suggests the best crop to plant based on soil type, weather, historical data, and other environmental factors using machine learning classification models.
